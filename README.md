## Devlog
My desk is like a scene, a place where I keep all my Game Objects, like my laptop, my table lamp, my monitor, and my programming rubber duck. Each of these items have unique attributes to them, like components. My laptop has a battery feature, and wifi and bluetooth connectivity. My Table lamp and monitor have LIghts and brightness settings. My subber duck has a vcertain amount of air which is what makes it float in a body of water. 
Components make up Game Objects which are placed within scenes to create an interactive game.
